# UnitedWeCode
In our project, we utilized Python to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on United Airlines' call center data. We systematically addressed missing values and identified key insights related to Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). By analyzing patterns and trends in customer interactions, we uncovered inefficiencies affecting operational performance. Based on our findings, we provided targeted recommendations aimed at enhancing call center efficiency, improving customer satisfaction, and optimizing agent performance. Our approach emphasizes proactive communication, sentiment-based routing, and tailored support for elite-level customers, all of which contribute to reducing resolution times and streamlining operations.
To run the code, ensure that all five files are placed in the same directory as the code when executing it in a Jupyter notebook. Before running the code, install the required libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The nltk library, which is also utilized in the analysis, will be installed automatically within the code.
